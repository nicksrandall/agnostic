# agnostic
A (tiny) framework agnostic component library built with [preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/).

## status
POC

## Concepts
- components are registered as custom-elements (web components).
- components are authored with preact.js (because it's tiny)
- compile-time autoprefixing and other postcss goodies happens for css

## Why?
I want to create a forward-leaning, framework agnostic way of developing reusable components to share across features/teams of large projects.

## Todo
- CSS editor plugin(s)
