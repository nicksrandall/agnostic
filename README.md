# agnostic
(tiny) framework agnostic components

## status
POC

## Concepts
- components are registered as custom-elements (web components).
- components are authored with preact.js (because it's tiny)
- compile-time autoprefixing happens on css

## Todo
- CSS editor plugins
- write examples in other frameworks (angular 1, react, angular N, vue, ect...)
